# eightgames-css-reset

Inspired by https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset, but shorter, only keeps those must-have and frequently resets. There are some reasons that I don't adopt every setting:

1. I create this css-reset mainly for tweaking and leanring css, not building serious application.
2. Nowdays no one really using native html element. We have UI libs.
3. No on would really adds the reset to existing project. So the meaning of this sheet is mainly for building attention and awareness, it shouldn't be too long.

Every line should be understandable.
